<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> I am a sports enthusiast with a big passion for football, the gym, and trying out different types of physical activities. I love the discipline and energy that sports bring into my life, and I apply the same mindset of consistency and growth to everything I do. Staying active helps me stay sharp, motivated, and ready to take on new challenges, both personally and professionally.
</p>

<p>I work as a digital marketer, where I get to combine creativity with strategy to help brands grow and succeed online. Beyond marketing, I also enjoy coding and diving into IT-related topics, always looking to expand my skills and learn something new. Iâ€™m curious by nature and driven by progress, which pushes me to keep improving in my career, in technology, and in my personal life.
